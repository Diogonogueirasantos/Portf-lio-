            <article>
                <p>
                    The first think that I tried to understand is "Why I need of a web site page?" so many cople times I just did not want to create a web site, this is because in my mind for to have a web site was necessary to make a complex web site (Yes, a stupid ideia), I think that this kind of thought is very normal for begginer like me, but the time pass and the wish to share my studie just grow up, so right now you should be know "why this strange guy created a web site".
                    Another thing that I want to say is that the English is not my mother tongue, but, everything that you will see in this portfolio is written in English.

            <p>I think that the wish of shareing our studies with orther people that like about the same subject is very commom, I mean what is the propose of study widthout share your progress? maybe I be wrong, but, horever I like to learn new things and aplie these new knowledges in a real project, maybe the way that I use these new knowled be wrong but, this is not a problem,  all right let get start, welcome to my portfolio.</p>

           <p>In this web page I will share everything thinkg that I am learning at the moment, this page does not have  a specific focus in any area, so probably you will see some randomic subject, for example, some subject that envolve Linux, or some programming language, or some thing about translations.</p>
